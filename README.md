# Predicting Birthweight (April 2024)

### Overview
In this project, I served as a public health consultant tasked with analyzing and predicting birthweight, a critical measurement that can signal complications in a baby's health. Utilizing various Computational Analytics and Machine Learning techniques, I aimed to identify key factors affecting birthweight and develop predictive models that could potentially save lives.

### Kaggle Competition
I participated in a Kaggle competition for this project and achieved 6th place ranking.

### Analysis Questions
- Correlation with Birthweight: Identified strong positive or negative correlations with birthweight.
- Threshold Birthweight: Determined the healthy and non-healthy birthweight using credible sources.
- Transformed Birthweight Analysis: Analyzed if correlations and phi coefficients improved after applying the birthweight threshold.
- Feature Impact: Identified features with the largest impact on birthweight and provided actionable insights for each.
- Confusion Matrix Analysis: Presented the final model's confusion matrix and explained the significance of false positives and false negatives, with a focus on correctly predicting low birthweight.

### Permitted Model Types
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification
- GBM Classification

### Analysis
- Data Visualization: Included insightful data visualizations with thorough explanations.
- Minimized Data Dumping: Utilized methods like .head() to keep the analysis concise.

### Code and Modeling Rules
- Model Types: Only used specified model types from scikit-learn.
- X-Variable Usage: Avoided polynomial or radical transformations of x-variables.
- Code Processing Time: Ensured the code runs within 60 seconds.
- Event Horizon: Included only features that can be collected before the event horizon.
- Best Practices: Maintained error-free code with ample comments.
